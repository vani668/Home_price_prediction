# Home_price_prediction
Machine Learning project to predict house prices using Python, EDA, and regression models.
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques.
The objective is to analyze housing data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocess features, train regression models, and evaluate their performance to predict accurate house prices.

Technologies & Tools Used:
1.Python
2.Jupyter Notebook
3.Pandas, NumPy
4.Matplotlib, Seaborn
5.Scikit-learn
6.Pickle (Model Saving)

Dataset & Analysis:
*Loaded housing dataset and analyzed structure using info() and describe()
*Handled missing values and encoded categorical features
*Performed Exploratory Data Analysis:
*Price distribution
*Feature vs price relationships
*Correlation heatmap
*Outlier detection
Screenshots available in the screenshots/ folder

Model Building:

Split data into training and testing sets
Trained regression models:
1.Linear Regression
2.Random Forest Regressor
Evaluated models using:
1.Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
2.Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
3.R² Score

Results & Visualizations:
Compared Actual vs Predicted house prices using:
1.Bar graph
Identified important features influencing house prices
Model Deployment

Best performing model saved as:
HomePriceModel.pkl
Model can be loaded and used for future predictions

Key Learnings
*Data cleaning and preprocessing
*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
*Regression modeling and evaluation
*Model saving and reuse
